    <p style="padding: 0 90px">
      There’s nothing cookie-cutter about Pizza Mania. Not our pizzas. Not our
      people. And definitely not the way we live life. Around here, we don’t
      settle for anything less than food we’re proud to serve. And we don’t just
      clock in. Not when we can also become our best, make friends, and have fun
      while we’re at it. We’re the pizza company that lives life unboxed. We’re
      not for people who want to blend in: pushing boundaries is part of our
      heritage. We have more than 16,000 restaurants and 350,000 team members in
      more than 100 countries. Whether it’s the original Stuffed Crust or
      putting a pizza in outer space, we never stop driving ourselves to deliver
      hot pizzas, fast every time – anywhere you want to enjoy it.

    <center><h1>What we're about?</h1></center>
    <p style="padding: 0 90px">
      At Pizza Mania, we don’t just make pizza. We make people happy. Pizza
      Mania was built on the belief that pizza night should be special, and we
      carry that belief into everything we do. With more than 55 years of
      experience under our belts, we understand how to best serve our customers
      through tried and true service principles: We create food we’re proud to
      serve and deliver it fast, with a smile.
    </p>
    <center><h1>Where are we from?</h1></center>
    <p style="padding: 0 90px">
      In 1958, two brothers borrowed $600 from their mom to open a pizza place
      in Wichita, Kansas. They named it Pizza Mania, because their sign only had
      room for eight letters. How profound! Soon, the restaurant grew. Why? The
      pizza was awesome. The service felt like home. And the customers were
      treated like family. And we’ve been delivering that same food and service
      ever since.
    </p>

    <center><h1>For the love of pizza since 1998</h1></center>
    <p style="padding: 0 90px">
      From day one, the Carney brothers could look their customers in the eye
      and promise them the finest pizza in town — because they knew the farmers
      who grew the ingredients, and they knew those farmers cared about quality.
      Since then, our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients
      we use are still our highest priority. No one loves pizza more than Pizza
      Mania. That’s why pizza is in our name — and always will be.

      In June 1996, Pizza Mania made its foray into India with a restaurant in
      Bangalore and was the first international restaurant chain to pioneer this
      category. The restaurant brand offers an exciting menu consisting of its
      signature pizzas, appetizers, pastas, desserts and beverages. Its
      trademark dining experience has been recognized by Brand Equity to make it
      the ‘Most Trusted Food Service Brand’ for 11 years in a row. Pizza Mania
      is the most preferred pizza brand in India, given its freshest, tastiest
      and affordable Pizzas.
